I am Ben Bleikamp. I am from Ohio, I live San Francisco, and I'm a designer at
[GitHub](http://github.com).

### Contact me

I respond to almost every tweet: [@bleikamp](http://twitter.com/bleikamp)

### Stuff I Use

* Burritos
* Coffee
* A [15" MacBook Pro](http://apple.com) with 8GB of RAM and a big SSD. It is often hooked up
to a 27" Apple Cinema Display. [Facebook](http://facebook.com) loads so fucking fast.
* I play Scramble with Friends on an iPhone.
* An [iPad](http://apple.com/ipad). It's the 3rd version. Their naming system is stupid.
* I participate in The Cloud™ with [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)
* I back up worry-free to [BackBlaze](http://backblaze.com)
* Wrinkle free shirts via a [Rowenta iron](http://www.amazon.com/Rowenta-DW8080-400-Hole-Stainless-Soleplate/dp/B00305H9U6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1336728600&sr=8-1)
* Filtered photos via [Instagram](http://instagram.com)

### Professional

In the past I've worked at companies like [Yelp](http://yelp.com) and
[Bleacher Report](http://bleacherreport.com). I've helped authors like
[Ramit Sethi](http://iwillteachyoutoberich.com) and
[Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com) launch their blogs and NYT best-selling
books. And I've worked with companies like [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com),
[Mint](http://mint.com), and [SEOmoz](http://seomoz.com).

I love to build things that people enjoy using. The Internet is a fantastic
place to do that.
