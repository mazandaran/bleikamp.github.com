<p>I have been building things on the Internet since I was in seventh grade. Right now I build things at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, the most amazing job in the world.</p>

<p>I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio. I lived in Columbus, Ohio while at college. I currently live in San Francisco, California. Someday I might live in New York City or Europe. But there's a pretty good chance I'll just never leave the West Coast. Since it's the best coast.</p>
